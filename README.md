# in-active-points_for_city_discord_in_minecraft
Do you have a discord server for your city on any minecraft server? Do you have inactive city members? You can install this bot and give out active and inactive points to your residents, and you can tell the residents “if you have a lot of inactive points, you will be kicked.” And you will do so 

(in the future it is planned to autobahn with a large number of inactive points).

Also, you can reward your residents for a large number of active points!
